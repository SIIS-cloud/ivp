The Integrity Verification Proxy (IVP) project has been the collective effort of many people.

Joshua Schiffman wrote the original version of IVP while a PhD
student at Penn State University.

Hayawardh Vijayakumar has also contributed immensely to IVP. As a PhD
student at Penn State University under the advisement of Dr. Trent Jaeger, Hayawardh
created several modules for IVP.
